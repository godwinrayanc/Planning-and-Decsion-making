Files in the folder
1. RRTstar - Main file to run the RRTstar program.
2. PRMDubins -  Main file to run the PRM program.
3. VisualiseParking - Adapted from Automated Driving Toolbox with some changes to visualise the simulation.
4. controlpurepursuit - Simulink File of rthe controller and robot model.
5. image3.jpeg        - Map which is converted binary occupancy map.

Steps to execute the MATLAB files
1. Open the RRTstar file and run the file
2. helperPlotVehicle error pops up and need to add the path displayed in the error as Visualizeparking is adopted from the toolbox.
3. Click Run and add to path, the simulation starts.
4. Steps 1-3 can be followed for PRMDubins

NOTE: The simulink file works only in MATLAB 2020b

Toolboxes used in MATLAB
